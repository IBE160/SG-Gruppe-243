## Case Title
AI CV & Job Application Assistant

## Background
Students and job seekers often struggle to tailor their applications and CVs to specific job postings. Creating a compelling CV and application letter that matches the required skills and tone takes time and experience. An AI-powered assistant can simplify this process and provide valuable insights into strengths, weaknesses, and missing qualifications.

## Purpose
The application aims to help students generate customized job applications using their existing CVs,previous applications, key words, and target job descriptions. It improves application quality by suggesting edits to both the CV and the application letter, identifying missing qualifications, and optimizing for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

## Target Users
- University and college students seeking internships or entry-level positions  
- Career counselors supporting students in the application process  
- Recent graduates looking to improve job application materials

## Core Functionality

### Must Have (MVP)
- **Personalized application generation:** Automatically creates a tailored application letter based on a user’s CV and a specific job posting.  
- **CV improvement suggestions:** Highlights areas for improvement such as wording, structure, tone/styel and keyword alignment.  
- **Qualification gap analysis:** Identifies missing or weak skills compared to job requirements.

### Nice to Have (Optional Extensions)
- **ATS optimization module:** Adjusts formatting and content to improve compatibility with automated screening systems (ATS).  
- **Language and tone customization:** Allows users to select writing style, tone, and language level for different industries or regions.

## Data Requirements
- **Users:** Name, email, login credentials (securely stored)  
- **Documents:** CVs (PDF/DOC/TXT), job postings, past applications  
- **Application Data:** Keywords, desired tone/style, AI-generated outputs (application letters, improvement suggestions)  

## User Stories
1. As a student, I want to upload my CV and a job posting so that I can get a customized application letter.  
2. As a student, I want to see what qualifications I’m missing so I can plan skill development.  
3. As a career counselor, I want to review AI-generated suggestions to provide feedback to students.

## Technical Constraints
- Must support secure login and encrypted data storage.  
- Must process PDF, DOC, and TXT files.  
- Internet access required for AI-based generation.  
- Must comply with GDPR and privacy best practices.

## Platform and Architecture
- **Platform:** Web Application
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, for a highly customizable and responsive user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript, providing a RESTful API for handling user authentication, document processing, and communication with the AI service.
- **Database:** MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for flexible storage of user profiles, CVs, and generated application materials.
- **AI Integration:** The backend will integrate with a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) via its API to provide the core functionality of application generation and CV analysis.

## Database Schema
The project will use MongoDB. The schema will be organized into three main collections:

**1. `users` Collection**
Stores essential user information for authentication and identification.
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "name": "String",
  "email": "String (unique)",
  "password": "String (hashed)",
  "createdAt": "Date",
  "updatedAt": "Date"
}
```

**2. `cvs` Collection**
Stores the CVs uploaded by a user. A user can have many CVs.
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "userId": "ObjectId (references a user)",
  "originalFilename": "String",
  "storagePath": "String (path to the stored file, e.g., on S3)",
  "extractedText": "String (the parsed text from the CV)",
  "createdAt": "Date"
}
```

**3. `generatedApplications` Collection**
Stores the results of each analysis, linking a user, a CV, and a job description.
```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "userId": "ObjectId (references a user)",
  "cvId": "ObjectId (references a cv)",
  "jobDescription": "String",
  "generatedLetter": "String (the tailored cover letter)",
  "analysisResults": {
    "qualificationGaps": ["String"],
    "cvImprovementSuggestions": ["String"],
    "atsKeywordsFound": ["String"]
  },
  "createdAt": "Date"
}
```

## Success Criteria
- Users can generate tailored applications in less than 5 minutes.  
- Stored data is securely encrypted and accessible only by authorized users.  
- AI suggestions demonstrably improve the relevance and clarity of applications.  
- High user satisfaction and engagement from student test groups.
