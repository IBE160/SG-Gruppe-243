Epic: Epic 2: CV Management & Job Description Input

---

## User Story

As a user, I want to paste a job description into a text area, so that the AI can compare it with my CV and help tailor my application.

---

## Requirements & Context Summary

This story implements the functionality for users to provide job description text to the system. This text will be a key input for the AI-powered features in Epic 3, enabling the assistant to tailor CVs and cover letters, and identify skill gaps. The system needs a robust way to capture and store this text securely, associated with the user.

### Key Requirements (from PRD / Epic)

-   FR4: The system MUST allow users to input a job description into a text area.
-   Epic 2 Tech Spec (Assumed/To Be Defined):
    -   User interface for text input.
    -   Secure storage of job description text.
    -   Association of job description with the authenticated user.
    -   (Future task) Pre-processing or validation of job description text.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Successful Input:** The user can paste and save a job description text into a dedicated input field.
2.  **Text Persistence:** The entered job description is saved securely and is retrievable for future use by the AI.
3.  **Association:** The saved job description is correctly associated with the authenticated user's account.
4.  **Input Length:** The system gracefully handles job descriptions of varying lengths (e.g., up to 10,000 characters).

## Technical Tasks

-   **Backend (Data Storage):**
    -   Implement tRPC procedure for saving job description (`jobDescription.save`).
    -   Define Prisma model for `JobDescription` (e.g., `id`, `userId`, `text`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).
    -   Associate job description with the authenticated user.
-   **Frontend (UI Components):**
    -   Create a page for job description input.
    -   Create a form component using `shadcn/ui` (e.g., `Textarea`, `Button`).
    -   Implement client-side validation (e.g., required field, max length).
    -   Handle form submission via `tRPC` mutation.
    -   Display success/error messages.

---

## Test Cases (To be defined in Test Design Epic 2)

-   **2.2-E2E-001 (P0):** User successfully inputs and saves a job description.
-   **2.2-API-001 (P1):** Attempt to save an empty job description.
-   **2.2-INT-001 (P1):** Saved job description is correctly associated with the user in the database.

---

## Technical Context / Dev Notes

-   **Data Model:** The `JobDescription` model will need a `text` field (type String, potentially a large string type if supported by Prisma/MongoDB).
-   **Security:** Ensure authentication and authorization for saving job descriptions.
-   **UI/UX:** Provide clear labels and instructions for the text area.
