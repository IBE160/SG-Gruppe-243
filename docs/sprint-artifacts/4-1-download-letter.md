Epic: Epic 4: Output & Download

## User Story

As a user, I want to download the generated application letter, so that I can save it to my computer and submit it with my job application.

---

## Requirements & Context Summary

This story enables users to export the AI-generated application letter. While PDF is the ultimate goal, a simple text file download or copy-to-clipboard functionality provides immediate value for the MVP.

### Key Requirements (from PRD / Epic)

-   FR7: The system MUST allow users to download the generated application letter.
-   Epic 4 Tech Spec (Assumed/To Be Defined):
    -   Client-side file generation (Blob).
    -   Download trigger via button.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Download Action:** A "Download" button is available on the generated letter view.
2.  **File Format:** Clicking the button downloads the current content of the letter as a file (e.g., `.txt` or `.md`).
3.  **Content Accuracy:** The downloaded file matches the text displayed in the editor.

## Technical Tasks

-   **Frontend (UI Components):**
    -   Add a "Download" button to `GenerateLetterView`.
    -   Implement the logic to create a `Blob` from the text content.
    -   Trigger the browser's download behavior.

## Test Cases (To be defined in Test Design Epic 4)
