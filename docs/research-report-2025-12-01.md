## 1. Research Objectives and Methodology

### Research Objectives

*   Understand the target users (students, recent graduates) in Norway.
*   Identify current market trends in recruitment technology in Norway.
*   Investigate the competitive landscape in Norway.
*   Analyze pricing and monetization models for similar tools.
*   Research the regulatory environment in Norway related to data privacy, AI, and employment.
*   Investigate the post-graduation employment rate for students in Norway to validate or invalidate the hypothesis that 'almost no students get work after studying'.

### Scope and Boundaries

- **Product/Service:** The application aims to help students generate customized job applications using their existing CVs, previous applications, key words, and target job descriptions. It improves application quality by suggesting edits to both the CV and the application letter, identifying missing qualifications, and optimizing for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
- **Market Definition:** AI-powered tools for job application assistance and career development for students and recent graduates in Norway and key adjacent Nordic/DACH markets.
- **Geographic Scope:** Primarily Norway, with adjacent markets of Sweden, Denmark, and Germany considered for TAM.
- **Customer Segments:** B2C (students, recent graduates).

### Research Methodology

Collaborative guided research using web searches (2025 data), focusing on market intelligence, customer analysis, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment.

### Data Sources

Specific market size data for the target niche in the specified regions (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany) was not found in public sources. The analysis relies on global market data for broader, related categories (AI in Recruitment, AI in Career Development) as a proxy for market direction and momentum. Confidence levels for specific data points are marked accordingly.

**Unverified Core Assumption:** After multiple targeted searches, no verifiable government, academic, or news data could be retrieved to confirm or deny the hypothesis that "a significant number of students in Norway struggle to find work post-graduation." The research will proceed assuming this hypothesis is true, and this should be a primary target for future, more in-depth research efforts.
