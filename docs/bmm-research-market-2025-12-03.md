**Limitation:**
Due to my operational constraints, I **could not perform live, real-time web searches** for external data verification, specific market statistics, or up-to-date competitor details beyond what was initially available or inferred. Therefore, this report's quantitative market data relies heavily on user-provided estimates. External facts presented are derived from summaries of prior (potentially outdated) search results. A traditional source audit against current, independently verified external data was not possible for all aspects of the research.
