# SWOT Analysis of the Research Plan

This SWOT analysis reviews the research plan for the "AI CV & Job Application Assistant" project.

**Strengths:**
*   **Highly Focused:** The tight geographic scope on "Primarily Norway" makes the research manageable and the insights specific and actionable.
*   **Comprehensive:** Covering Users, Market Trends, Competitors, Pricing, and Regulations provides a holistic, 360-degree view.
*   **User-Centric:** Starting with "Target Users" ensures the research remains grounded in user needs, not just abstract market data.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Potential for Geographic Myopia:** Focusing only on Norway might cause us to miss broader Scandinavian or European trends that could soon enter the Norwegian market.
*   **Risk of Data Scarcity:** Specific, reliable market data for Norway (e.g., AI adoption in HR tech, local market size) might be harder to find than for larger markets like the US or UK.
*   **Potential Language Barrier:** Our web research may be limited to English-language sources, potentially missing key insights from Norwegian-only reports, forums, or news.

**Opportunities:**
*   **Identify a Replicable Niche:** A deep understanding of the Norwegian market could reveal a successful GTM strategy that we can replicate in other similar-sized Nordic or European markets.
*   **Uncover a Regulatory Advantage:** The focus on Norwegian regulations might uncover a specific compliance-related feature that larger, more generic competitors overlook.
*   **Sharpen the MVP Scope:** The research could help us identify a very specific, underserved niche within the Norwegian student population, leading to a more focused and impactful Minimum Viable Product.

**Threats:**
*   **Rapid Market Evolution:** The AI and recruitment tech markets are changing so quickly that some of our findings could become outdated shortly after the research is completed.
*   **Risk of Misinterpretation:** Without deep local cultural context, we might misinterpret some of the data related to the Norwegian job market and student behavior.
*   **Resource Allocation:** The research, while valuable, will consume time and resources. We must ensure the insights gained are actionable enough to justify this cost.
