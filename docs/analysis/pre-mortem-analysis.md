# Pre-mortem Analysis

This document outlines a pre-mortem analysis for the "AI CV & Job Application Assistant" project, conducted during the Advanced Elicitation workflow.

**The Scenario:** It is one year from launch, and the "AI CV & Job Application Assistant" project has been shut down. We're conducting a post-mortem to understand what went wrong.

**Likely Reasons for Failure:**

1.  **The "Good Enough" Problem:** The AI-generated content was only slightly better than what users could produce on their own. The perceived value wasn't compelling enough to drive growth, and users churned after the first try.

2.  **The CV Parsing Nightmare:** We never reliably solved the problem of parsing diverse CV formats. Users with anything but the most basic layouts had a terrible experience, leading to a flood of negative reviews that sank our reputation before we could get started.

3.  **A Devastating Data Breach:** A security vulnerability was exploited, exposing thousands of user CVs and personal details. The legal and reputational fallout was catastrophic, forcing an immediate shutdown.

4.  **Blindsided by a Titan:** While we were perfecting our standalone app, a major platform (like LinkedIn or Indeed) launched a similar, integrated feature for free. Our potential user base vanished overnight.

5.  **Unsustainable AI Costs:** The API costs for the Large Language Model were far higher than projected. Our pricing model couldn't cover the operational expenses, and we were unable to secure further funding.
