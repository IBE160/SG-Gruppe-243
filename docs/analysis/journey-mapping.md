# User Journey Map: First-Time Student Application Generation

This User Journey Map visualizes the end-to-end process for a student generating a customized application letter, based on User Story 1, conducted during the Advanced Elicitation workflow focusing on UI needs.

| Stage | User Actions | UI Touchpoints | User Thoughts (Internal Monologue) | User Feelings | UI Opportunities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Discovery & Onboarding** | Sees the tool online. Clicks "Sign Up". Fills out form. Verifies email. | Landing page, Sign Up button, Registration form, Email inbox, Verification page. | "This looks useful. Is it safe to upload my CV? How much does it cost? Let's give it a try." | Curious, Hopeful, Cautious | Display social proof (testimonials). Make pricing and privacy policies prominent. Keep the sign-up form minimal. |
| **2. Initial Setup** | Logs in for the first time. Is prompted to upload a CV. | Login page, Empty-state Dashboard, "Upload CV" button / Drag-and-drop area. | "Okay, I'm in. What now? Ah, upload my CV. I hope it can read my file format correctly." | Anxious, Expectant | A single, clear call-to-action on the dashboard. Provide instant visual feedback on successful upload and parsing. |
| **3. Core Task Execution** | Finds the 'new application' area. Pastes a job description. Clicks "Generate". Waits. | Large, clearly labeled text area for job description. A prominent "Generate" button. Loading indicator/animation. | "This is the magic moment. I wonder how long it will take. I hope the output is actually good." | Impatient, Hopeful | Use an engaging loading animation. Show example outputs or tips while they wait to manage expectations. |
| **4. Review & Refine** | Reads the generated letter. Views CV suggestions and skill gaps. Makes edits to the letter. | Results page with tabs/sections for the letter, suggestions, and gaps. In-line text editor. | "Wow, this is a great starting point! Some parts need my personal touch. Oh, I see I'm missing that skill—that's useful to know." | Impressed, Empowered, Creative | Offer a rich text editor. Use "Copy to Clipboard" buttons. Make suggestions clear and actionable, perhaps with links to external resources for missing skills. |
| **5. Completion & Off-boarding**| Is happy with the letter. Downloads the final document. | "Download" button (with format options like PDF/DOCX). | "Perfect! This saved me so much time. I'm ready to submit my application now. I'll definitely use this again." | Confident, Relieved, Satisfied | Allow saving multiple versions of an application. After download, show a "Start a new application" CTA. Prompt for feedback on their experience. |
