# Stakeholder Mapping

This document outlines a Stakeholder Map for the "AI CV & Job Application Assistant" project, conducted during the Advanced Elicitation workflow.

**High Influence / High Interest (Manage Closely)**
*   **End-Users (Students, Recent Graduates):** They are the core of the project. Their satisfaction, feedback, and adoption will determine success.
    *   *Engagement Strategy:* Continuous feedback loops, user testing, intuitive onboarding, and transparent communication.
*   **Project Owner / Primary Decision-Makers:** They control the project's budget, timeline, and strategic direction.
    *   *Engagement Strategy:* Regular status updates, clear reports on progress and risks, and direct involvement in key decisions.

**High Influence / Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)**
*   **University Career Services Departments:** They can be a powerful channel for user acquisition. They have significant influence over students but a low direct interest in our tool unless it aligns perfectly with their existing programs.
    *   *Engagement Strategy:* Demonstrate clear value for their students, offer partnership opportunities, and ensure the tool is easy for them to recommend.
*   **Regulatory Bodies (e.g., Data Protection Authorities):** They have high influence through their legal authority but low interest in the project itself, only in its compliance with regulations like GDPR.
    *   *Engagement Strategy:* Proactive compliance, clear privacy policies, and readiness for audits.

**Low Influence / High Interest (Keep Informed)**
*   **Recruiters & Hiring Managers:** As the ultimate audience of the generated documents, they have a high interest in the quality of applications they receive, but they have no direct influence over our tool.
    *   *Engagement Strategy:* Monitor hiring trends, gather feedback from recruiters on what makes a good application, and ensure our AI suggestions align with industry expectations.
*   **Development Team:** They have a deep interest in the project's execution and success but less influence over its overall strategic direction compared to the project owner.
    *   *Engagement Strategy:* Clear requirements, well-defined tasks, and protection from scope creep.

**Low Influence / Low Interest (Monitor)**
*   **The General Public / Media:** Their interest will only become high in the event of a major success or a public failure (like a data breach).
    *   *Engagement Strategy:* General brand awareness and a crisis communication plan.
