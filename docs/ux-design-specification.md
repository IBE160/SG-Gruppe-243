## Executive Summary

{{project_vision}}

---

## 1. Design System Foundation

### 1.1 Design System Choice

**Decision:** shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS

**Rationale:** Aligns with the project's T3 Stack architecture, offering highly customizable, accessible, and modern UI components. Provides full control over component code for tailored "Classic Professional" look.

---

## 2. Core User Experience

### 2.1 Defining Experience

**Core Loop:** "Paste & Generate" (The Confidence Mirror)
The primary user action is efficient: users log in (with CV already stored) -> paste a job description -> receive a tailored application package.

**The Soul of the Experience:** Validation & Translation.
The value isn't just saving time; it's providing immediate external validation of the student's potential. The app acts as a mirror, reflecting their best professional self back to them.

**Emotional Goal:** Empowered, Ready, Professional.
Users should feel they have a "secret weapon" that makes them competitive. The interface should inspire confidence, not anxiety.

**Key Journey Moments:**
1.  **Input:** Real-time skill highlighting as they paste the job description (feedback that the system "understands").
2.  **Processing:** Transparent status updates ("Identifying your matching strengths...") to build trust.
3.  **Reveal:** The "Mirror" moment. Results presented beautifully with annotations explaining *why* specific strengths were highlighted ("Emphasized your Hackathon project to match the 'Leadership' requirement").

### 3.1 Color System

**Color Theme:** Classic Professional

**Palette Intent:** A strong, trustworthy blue as a primary accent for key actions and branding. Clean, subtle grays and whites for backgrounds and text to ensure professionalism and readability. A potential subtle accent color for highlights or success states.
